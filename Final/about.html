<img src="Images/sean.jpg" alt="A Picture Of Me">
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  I am a 20 year old award winning Unity Certified User Programmer with 
creative work in 2D and 3D interactive media projects. As the primary designer and programmer
 of all created projects I continue to study Unity scripting, component based architecture, 
iterative level design principles, Japanese, and pixel art in my personal life. 
In my academic life, I am currently a Junior studying Computer Science and Vice President of
 the NJIT IGDA Club. <br>

​
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Working with Life Skills Software has allowed for me to collaborate in a modern software 
company based in Scrum workflow strategies, and deliver 3D game projects to educators for 
use in the classroom for special need students. 
<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My work on Angel Feathers has taught me important fundamentals of project management and 
cohesive design, as well as developing for a mobile platform. I've applied this knowledge 
while leading my team for Life Skills Software and Otsuka Pharmaceuticals. 
Collaborating and incorporating other team members idea's and allowing each member to do exciting and 
new work has created a environment that is full of creativity and passion among all team members.

​<br>

I am currently looking for design, and management internship opportunities. 
Talking to me is easy and all it takes is one email
